# Forecasting-future-statistical-measures-of-temperature-of-a-place
In this project, I have developed a time series model to predict the mean, max, and min future temperatures for a particular Mandal of a specific district. The dataset used for the model training and evaluation includes historical temperature data for the Mandal, collected over a specific period.

The model has been designed using a combination of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to forecast the future temperature trends for the Mandal. The model uses historical temperature data to identify seasonal patterns, trends, and cyclic variations and uses this information to make predictions about the future temperature values.

The model has been evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE). The evaluation results indicate that the model has good predictive accuracy, and it can provide reliable temperature forecasts for the Mandal.
